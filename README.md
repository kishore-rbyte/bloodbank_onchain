## Title of the Project
A SECURE AND EFFICIENT BLOCKCHAIN-BASED
BLOOD DONATION AND TRANSFER SYSTEM ON
THE POLYGON NETWORK

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The One-Blood project emerges at the intersection of blockchain technology and
healthcare, with a central focus on revolutionizing the traditional processes of blood
donation and transfer. In contemporary healthcare systems, ensuring the safety,
traceability, and timely availability of donated blood is paramount for effective patient
care. One-Blood addresses these challenges by integrating cutting-edge technologies
such as Solidity and React to create a secure and transparent platform. Blood donation
has always been a critical aspect of healthcare, and the project aims to augment this
process by leveraging the inherent security features of blockchain. Donors can
contribute blood at campsites or blood banks, and their information, including
Aadhaar numbers, blood group, and a unique Blood ID, is recorded on an immutable
blockchain. This initial blockchain entry serves as a foundational step in establishing a
trustworthy and traceable blood supply chain. However, the significance of the
One-Blood project extends beyond donor information recording. After the initial
blockchain entry, the donated blood undergoes rigorous physical testing, with the
results determining its safety status. The subsequent generation of a QR code,
incorporating crucial details and a hash of the batch number, ensures the verifiability
and traceability of each blood packet.

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
Blockchain Node Servers: The system requires dedicated servers to run Ethereum nodes for blockchain transactions and smart contract execution. These servers should have sufficient processing power, memory, and storage to handle the decentralized nature of the blockchain.

Storage Infrastructure: Adequate storage is crucial for maintaining the blockchain's distributed ledger. A scalable and high-capacity storage solution is essential to accommodate the increasing volume of digital documents over time.

Secure User Devices: End-user devices, such as computers or mobile devices, should adhere to standard security protocols to ensure safe interactions with the digital locker. Secure devices contribute to the overall security of document retrieval and storage.

Blockchain Software: The system relies on Ethereum blockchain software for deploying and executing smart contracts. This includes Ethereum clients like Geth or Parity to run blockchain nodes.
Smart Contract Development Tools: Development tools for Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, are essential. Tools like Remix or Truffle can facilitate the creation, testing, and deployment of smart contracts.

Web Development Frameworks: The frontend of the system is built using React.js, necessitating the inclusion of Node.js for server-side rendering and Express.js for managing backend functionalities. These frameworks contribute to a dynamic and responsive user interface.

Encryption Libraries: Integration of encryption techniques requires cryptography libraries such as OpenSSL or libraries provided by programming languages to ensure secure document storage and data confidentiality.
